CS 5363, Spring 2015, Project Template
======================================


Main Object
===========

Your code should expect to be started with the invocation of the ``main``
method of the appropriate class in the default package.  The main method
for ``helloworld`` is included in the initial checkin of your repository.
Template main methods for ``warmup`` and ``core`` will be provided
in the template repositories provided with the assignment instructions
of each of those project submissions.
